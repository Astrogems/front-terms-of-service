                    Astrogems allows users to purchase in-app currency through
                    the use of Telegram Stars. Once the user has spent Telegram

                    transaction is considered final, and we do not offer refunds
                    for unwanted or unintentional purchases. <br />
                    The use of Telegram Stars within Astrogems is governed by
